## How to Use this Repo
Rather than 50 disjointed folders of answers for the 2020 calendar, this repo is a unified python command line tool to select a question, run the solution's program, and prints the solution.

This tool is made freely available for anyone interested in various approaches to the Advent of Code puzzles. You can simply read the code on GitHub or clone it to your machine (or a codespace) and run it yourself!

## Contributions
Alternative solutions, Bug Fixes, and General Issues are welcome! Please be aware the main branch is locked down to pr only with review.

Thank you so much to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)!
